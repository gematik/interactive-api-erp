# TestData Creator using JSON Forms React

- Execute `npm start` to start the application.

Browse to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.

## File Structure

Let's briefly have a look at the most important files:

- `src/*Payload.json` contains the JSON schemas
- `src/*Schema.json` contains the UI schemas if needed
- `src/index.tsx` is the entry point of the application. We also customize the Material UI theme to give each control more space.
- `src/App.tsx` is the main app component and makes use of the `JsonForms` component in order to render a form.


## Usage

For development use `npm run start`.

For deployment use `npm run deploy`.
